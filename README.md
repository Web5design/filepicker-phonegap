## Filepicker.io Phonegap samples and library

Some custom code for integrating Filepicker.io into Phonegap. Required the ChildBrowser plugin. Most of the functionality is almost identical to the JS api, with a few exceptions:
* You cannot specify "multiple" or "container" because they don't make sense on mobile
* No support for a drag-drop widget, because it too doesn't make sense on mobile
